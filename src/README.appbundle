The things you need to do to create a full app bundle:

1) remove comment the "#CONFIG -= app_bundle # no MacOS app bundle for now" line obviously
2) "make"
3) "macdeployqt pview.app" - this copies all of the necessary qt libraries into the app bundle

This should be enough to make it runnable on any recent OSX. I am not 100% sure if you also need to bundle the expat library, but I think it is included automatically.

Thermo2PVIEW converts ThermoFinnigan .RAW files to PVIEW compatible
.mzXML files.

Note these files do not comply to the actual .mzXML format. They are
however compatible with PVIEW. In future version the .mzXMLs will be
fully compliant.

MSFileReaderSetup.zip can be downloaded from here.

package.  qt-win-opensource-4.x.x-vs2008.exe

Run the QT command prompt. Change to the directory containing
the source code.

Run the following commands

qmake
nmake

You'll find thermo2pview.exe in the "release" subdirectory.

You need the following in the same directory to run Thermo2PVIEW.
